## Project Overview

This project aims to identify **abnormal driving behavior** by analyzing vehicle trajectories using **spatio-temporal features** extracted from **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) videos**.

### Driving Behavior Variations
While drivers are generally expected to exhibit consistent behavior on the same roads, **real-world conditions** introduce variations. These deviations are often due to:
- Individual decision-making
- Traffic and road conditions
- Environmental and external factors

### Need for Abnormality Detection
Detecting irregular or risky driving behavior is essential for:
- **Traffic safety** and early intervention
- **Accident prevention** and post-incident analysis
- **Autonomous vehicle systems** and driver assistance modules

## Project Goals
- Develop a machine learning model using trajectory data
- Extract meaningful spatio-temporal features from UAV footage
- Classify and flag abnormal driving patterns in real-time or batch analysis
